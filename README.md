# Template Database

A handy tool for packing and cataloguing Scriptable Objects of a given type into one database.

Can be gathered via Reflection from everywhere in the project by pressing "Refresh" button in the Editor on a selected database.

Every template object is required to have a unique string id,which is automatically filled based on the object name (enforcing requirement for every Scriptable Object to have a unique name).
